Walmart Data Analysis Project
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of Walmart sales data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). The objective was to uncover key business insights related to sales trends, shipping duration, and product category performance.

Key Analyses & Insights:
✅ State-wise & Category-wise Analysis: Identified the total number of states in the dataset and analyzed the distribution of product categories.

✅ Order & Shipping Insights: Examined order dates and calculated the average shipping duration across different locations.

✅ Sales & Trends Visualization: Used data visualization techniques to explore sales performance trends over time.

✅ Performance Metrics: Determined the most frequently purchased product categories and their impact on sales.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib for graphical representation of insights.
Data Processing: Extracted key features such as order quarters and shipping duration to enhance business insights.
